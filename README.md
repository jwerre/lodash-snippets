# Lo-Dash.js Snippets for Atom Editor
Some snippets to quickly use Lo-Dash Library in Atom.

The Arrays, Collections, Functions, Objects, and Utilities parts of the library are implemented currently. I would love to extend the snippets to the complete [Lo-Dash functionality](https://lodash.com/docs).

Inspired by the [atom-undescorejs](https://github.com/tianpermana/atom-underscorejs) package by Tian Permana.

## Install
```bash
apm install lodash-snippets
```

Or Settings ➔ Install ➔ Search for `lodash`
