# Lo-Dash.js Snippets for Atom Editor

Some snippets to quickly use Lo-Dash Library in AtomEditor. Only the Array and collections part of the library are implemented as these are the parts I use the most.

Inspired by the [atom-undescorejs](https://github.com/tianpermana/atom-underscorejs) package by Tian Permana.
