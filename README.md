# Lo-Dash.js Snippets for Atom Editor

Some snippets to quickly use Lo-Dash Library in AtomEditor.

Only the Array and collections part of the library are implemented as these are
the parts I use the most. I would love to extend the snippets to the complete
lodash functionality.

Install:
```bash
apm install lodash-snippets
```
Feel free to contribute with issues or PRs!
